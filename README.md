# github-changelog

This is a small utility that generates a changelog between two git tags based on GitHub pull request titles as either plaintext or markdown.

An example might look like this:

- Improve test coverage for mygreatpackage.subpackage [#1234]()
- Add support for Python 3 [#1233]()

## Installing

```
pip install github-changelog
```

## Using

```
changelog [-h] [-m] OWNER REPO [PREVIOUS] [CURRENT]
```

The `changelog` command takes a GitHub repository owner (user or organization), repository name and zero, one, or two tags to limit the set of changes to consider. If no tags are provided, the changelog will be computed between the latest tag and `HEAD`. One tag may be provided to set the base tag to compare against `HEAD`. Two tags may be provided to specify both base tag and ending tag. The generated changelog will list all GitHub pull requests that have been merged between the specified or inferred tags. If `-m` is specified the output will be formatted in markdown and include links to the pull requests.

Pull request merges are identified by their commit message, usually taking the form of `Merge pull request #123â€¦`. Squash-and-merged pull requests are identified by having the PR number in parentheses at the end of first line of the commit message.

### Examples

```
changelog cfpb github-changelog
```

Will generate a text changelog between the latest tag and `HEAD`.

```
changelog cfpb github-changelog 1.0.0
```

Will generate a text changelog between `1.0.0` and `HEAD`.

```
changelog -m cfpb github-changelog 1.0.0 1.0.1
```

Will generate a markdown changelog between `1.0.0` and `1.0.1`.

## Overriding the Default Branch

The default branch is set to `main`. To override this, use the optional `--branch` argument to specify a different branch. For example:

```bash
changelog owner some-repo \
--branch "production"
```

## GitHub Enterprise Support

Use the optional `--github-base-url`, `--github-api-url`, and `--github-token` arguments to connect to a GitHub Enterprise instance. For example:

```bash
changelog owner some-repo \
--github-base-url "https://github.company.com" \
--github-api-url "https://github.company.com/api/v3" \
--github-token secret-value
```
